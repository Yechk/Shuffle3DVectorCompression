# Shuffle3DVectorCompression
Alex Eager's Vector 3 Compression Algorithm

Compresses the data of a 3 float vector to the space of a 2 float vector
This is a lossy method of compression and more of an experiment than anything
The Average margin for error after decompression is fairly low, but this of course depends on the application

My reasoning for this was to create a way to compress model data in GPU RAM more efficiently.
I have not dived into testing that implementation yet

Feel free to use/change this software for any purpose
